Convert DNA sequences to longest amino acide sequence for all six reading frames

I suppose you do not want to keep the package installed, thus I recommend
to install it in a fresh virtual environment.

Clone the repository then change into the directory and execute:
`pip install .`

Uninstall:
`pip uninstall na2aa`

## Usage

`na2aa -`

## Example

In the example folder, run:
